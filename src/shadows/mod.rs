// PCF & PCSS

// Percentage-Close Filtering (PCF) is a technique used in shadow mapping to create soft shadows by averaging the depth values of nearby texels.
// This method reduces the harshness of shadow edges and helps to create a more realistic appearance in rendered scenes.
// PCF works by sampling multiple points around the shadow map's projected area and using the results to determine the visibility of the surface.

// Percentage-Close Soft Shadows (PCSS) is an extension of PCF that further enhances the softness of shadows.
// It takes into account the size of the light source and the distance from the occluder to the receiver,
// allowing for dynamic adjustments to the shadow softness based on these parameters. PCSS can produce more natural-looking shadows,
// particularly in scenes with large light sources.
