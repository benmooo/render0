# Physically Based Shading
---

< Let the form of an object be what it may, --light, shade, and perspective will always make it beautiful. -- John Constable

In this chapter we cover the various aspects of physically based shading. We start with a
description of the physics of light-matter interactions, and show how these physics connect
to the shading process. and then dedicated to the building blocks used to construct physically
based shading models, and the models themselves-covering a broad variety of material types.
how materials blender together, and we cover filtering methods for avoiding aliasing and
preserving surface appearance.

### Physics of Light
The interactions of light and matter form the foundation of physically based shading. To understand
these interactions, it helps to have a basic understanding of the nature of light.

so what is light?

Light, an electromagnetic transverse wave. The electric and magnetic field vectors oscillate at
90* to each other and to the direction of propagation. The wave shown in the figure is the simplest
possible light wave. It is both monochromatic(has a siingle wavelength h) and linearly polarized(the eletric and
magnetic fields each oscillate along a single line)

In Physical optics, light is modeled as an electromagnetic transverse wave, a wave that oscillates
the electirc and magnetic fields perpendicular to the direction of propagation. The O
